# Preface 

## Tutorial goals

To help people conducting planned agricultural field trials to understand and  incorporate spatial variation routinely into analysis of field trials.  

current resources are focused on geospatia appications - LANDSAT data across large area, point information on soils and geology, and other information that typiically requiresa a moderate to deep understanding of obht GIS tools and spatial analytica techniques. 

Furthermore, there is not a comprehensive one-stop-shop for spatial analytical techniques for field experiments that is also freely available. 

## Prerequisites

In order to run the scripts in this demonstration, you will to download R, avaiable free through the [Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org/). While this is sufficient for running R scripts, You may also find it hepful to use RStudio, which provides a nice graphical user interface for R. RStudio can be downloaded [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

If you already have R installed, please make sure you have version 3.5.0 or newer. 

This demonstration is not intended to provide instructions on general R usage. However, There are numerous web resources for learning the Basics of R. [Software carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/) offers several lesson plans covering the foundation of R.  

## Packages used in this tutorial
