# Conclusion {#the-end}

## Other packages
There are several other packages for exploring and modeling spatial variability in field trials. 

|package |usage |
|-------------|-------------|
| Mcspatial | nonparametric spatial analysis |
|ngspatial | spatial models with a focus on generalised linear models |
|spaMM  | correlated error modes and generalised linear models |
| sommer | mixed models, including an AR1xAr1 model, but it does not estimate $/rho$ parameters |
| spatialreg |    |

The package **sommer** implements a version of the AR1xAR1 covariance structure. However, it does not estimate the parameter $\rho$. The user must specify the $\rho$ and that value is not optimized in the restricted maximum likelihood estimation. There may be another way to implement the AR1xAR1 spatial model using the package **TMB**. Both SAS and Asreml can implement a mixed model with this covariance structure.

A [spAMM tutorial](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/f-rousset/spaMM-ref/master/vignettePlus/MixedModels_useR2021.pdf) is available for exploring this package more. 

## Final recommendations

Spatial analysis is a big topic, but I think it is worth the effort to learn and implement in analysis of field trials. This guide provides some minimal recipes for how to incorporate spatial information into field trial statistical analysis. 

There is no denying that work is needed to develop scripts that automate this process so researchers can routinely incorporate spatial covariance into field trial analysis. Many current R tools are unwieldy to use and have insufficient options to support variety trial analysis.

Until this situation is improved, it is probably wisest to focus on using spatial models that are well-supported at this time. Any of the options implemented in the **nlme** package (or that work with that package) are decent choices with excellent support for extracting least-squares means, running ANOVA, and standard model diagnostics. Furthermore, **nlme** supports generalized linear models. 

Investigating spatial correlation in a field trial and controlling for it if necessary is recommended over doing nothing.
