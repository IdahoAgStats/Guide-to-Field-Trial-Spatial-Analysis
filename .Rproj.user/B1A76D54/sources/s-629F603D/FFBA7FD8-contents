# Spatial Models

The termas "residual"and "error terms" are used interchangebly. 


## Correlation Errors

### Spherical

### Exponential

### Gaussian

### Mat√©rn

### Auto-regressive (AR)
Sometimes called a "lag" model

*one dimension*


*two dimensions*


### Moving averge (MA)
Sometimes called an "error model"

*one dimension*


*two dimensions*



### ARIMA 
Combined AR and MA approaches

*one dimension*


*two dimensions*

## Nearest Neighbor Approaches

These approaches look at the residuals from adjacent plots residuals to model error terms. 

## Trend Analysis

### Row, column and combined and row plus column trends. 

### Splines
